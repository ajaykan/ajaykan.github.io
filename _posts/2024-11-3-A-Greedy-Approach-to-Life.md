*Greedy algorithms* are a problem solving technique in computer science. They're designed to make the best short-term decision at every possible step. The opposite is purported in the real world: delayed gratification and long term thinking. The logic is sound. But I’ve found that prioritizing the short term has led to long term success. Hear me out.

We’re dynamic ‘agents’. Our desires and state are constantly evolving. What we wanted just yesterday may differ entirely from now. It’s ludicrous to think we can accurately predict ourselves across any time horizon. So just optimize for now. Concentrate efforts on what yields results fastest. Your desires are going to change. But at least when they do, you’ve maximized the previous period of your life. This can mean listening to that new song while it’s still fresh, or hanging out with a old friend while they’re still in town. The song will get old. Your friend will move. Enjoy both right now because neither is meant to last. 

Long term thinking has actually hindered my growth. Our world is too complicated to accurately comprehend our action’s implications. I’ve spent months deliberating the optimal action in line with my long term thinking. Many areas of my life stagnated. Now, I prioritize the short term. What can I do right now to improve my situation? What do I feel an unconscious calling towards? Answering these questions gives me immediate, actionable insights. 

The key is to exploit heavily. You’ve just discovered this new path. Maybe it’s a career path, business opportunity, or workout routine. Concentrate efforts. Exploit greedily while you have the fire. That’s what makes this algorithm effective: swift and abundant results. Let’s say you’ve answered the previous questions. They’ve given you some kind of direction. Don’t approach it with the same hesitation marking all your previous actions. The beauty of this philosophy is a sheer lack of commitment. Your current iteration is designed to end. So you’re free to explore to your heart’s content, then pass it off for a better opportunity.

A greedy approach to life is liberating. We’re acknowledging that we can’t fully understand our actions’ consequences. As a result, we prioritize what we think is correct *right now*, and allow this experience to refine our future decision-making ability.

This is not an excuse to unrestrained hedonism. Such a mindset is actually antithetical to this philosophy. Unabashed pleasure actually make everyday life less enjoyable, thereby completely opposing my proposed greedy approach to life. 

It sometimes seems like these short term movements don’t build to a larger goal. Instead, I’ve found that small, intermediary successes actually formed the foundation of my more monumental achievements. Unfortunately, these are only ever understood in hindsight. 

Greedy algorithms are a poor choice for coding interviews, but fairly effective in real life. My biggest victories have come from being greedy. Until this philosophy burns me irreparably, it’s likely I’ll continue with it.
